Humans love shortcuts. We love finding better, easier, and quicker ways of doing things. This has allowed us to innovate and automate away many of the mundane parts of life. It also has allowed us to progress the general standard of living exponentially.
This shortcut nature usually proves us well. We&rsquo;re scrappy, we&rsquo;re creative, and we know how to handle hard things. However, a critical ingredient to healthy progression is ethical direction. When Ethics are lacking, individuals and groups tend to look for shortcuts that bypass important issues such as human rights and ownership."><meta name=author content="Tyler Webb"><link rel=canonical href=https://tylerwebb.io/posts/tools_and_weapons_part_2_cybersecurity-copy/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://tylerwebb.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://tylerwebb.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://tylerwebb.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://tylerwebb.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://tylerwebb.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://tylerwebb.io/posts/tools_and_weapons_part_2_cybersecurity-copy/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://tylerwebb.io/posts/tools_and_weapons_part_2_cybersecurity-copy/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Tyler Webb."><meta property="og:title" content="Tools and Weapons Review Part 2: Cybersecurity - The Wake-Up Call for the World"><meta property="og:description" content="Cyber Security: The Wake-up Call for the World Humans love shortcuts.

There are many nefarious motivations to commit cyber crime. These can be for financial, vengeful, or political reasons, among many others. Whatever the reason, the side effects of cyber crime are negative and hurt individuals, organizations, and countries in various ways.

This includes the massive widespread attacks and damages that occurred from the WannaCry ransomware worm, a tool that was enabled with the weaponization of a vulnerability attributed to the National Security Agency and subsequently leaked by the Shadow Broker group. The final WannaCry package was potentially packaged and released by a group associated with the North Korean government. WannaCry proves the power of weaponized vulernabilities and is an example of a sophisticated Cyber Weapon.\nAs more of the world becomes automated and interconnected through a variety of networks, the potential to wreak havoc at scale and from a remote and anonymous position continues to grow as well. It will continue to become imperative for companies and governments across the earth to work together to control their cyber weapons and come to some necessary agreements. In a world where attribution is not as simple as just looking at satellite imagery to see who launched a missile or mobilized their forces, new levels of trust and defensive capabilities need to be developed and put in place to protect innocent livelihoods, and even lives, from the dramatic harm that can occur via weapons deployed at scale with no little to no variable cost.\nIndividual education on how to stay safe in the rising digital world will also continue to be incredibly important.

It rests more squarely on the shoulders of companies and governments that develop the products, platforms, and services upon which humanity stands and runs their lives. These platforms need to be secure to a fault and need to be carefully watched over. A secure system needs to be designed from the beginning. Security is not an afterthought. It’s not a line item.
