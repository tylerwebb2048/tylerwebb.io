      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his book, Tools and Weapons, Brad Smith lays out a series of important considerations for the continued adoption of artificial intelligence into an ever increasing amount of applications and daily uses. While artificial intelligence has historically held a rather loose definition, Brad Smith quotes Dave Heiner of Microsoft who describes AI as &amp;ldquo;a computer system that can learn from experience by discerning patterns in data fed to it and thereby make decisions&amp;rdquo; (Tools and Weapons pg. 194). This ability to learn based on experience and modeling is integral to creating flexible systems that can react to their environments in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity is truly one of humanity&amp;rsquo;s most impactful and profound discoveries. We&amp;rsquo;ve successfully harnessed electrons to rid our world of darkness at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice, communicate with other people over large distances, drive our cars, restart human hearts, and so much more. The harnessing of electricity has been an innovation that has seen no bounds. It has wove itself into the very fabric of humanity and had drastic effects that one no could have possibly predicted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
